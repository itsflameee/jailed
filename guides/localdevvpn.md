## What is it?
LocalDevVPN is a developer tool for creating and managing local network tunnels directly on iOS. It gives you a secure, isolated virtual interface for testing and debugging without sending traffic to external servers
(Information taken from the [official LocalDevVPN GitHub repository](https://github.com/jkcoxson/LocalDevVPN)).
In our case, this tool is used to enable proper functionality of on-device applications such as SideStore, StikDebug, EnsWilde, and others.

## Installation
LocalDevVPN can be installed from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/localdevvpn/id6755608044) or via [AltStore PAL](https://api.altstore.io/source/adp.se2crid.me?app=com.jkcoxson.LocalDevVPN)  
(Links are taken from the [official LocalDevVPN GitHub repository](https://github.com/jkcoxson/LocalDevVPN))

No additional configuration is required.  
For on-device applications (such as SideStore, StikDebug, and EnsWilde) to work properly, simply install the app and tap **“Connect”**.
